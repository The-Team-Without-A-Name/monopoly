# Monopoly

This is a multiplayer Monopoly game that runs on a remote server while players connect via the client desktop application on their machines.
This will fulfill the project requirements for the CS3321 Course Project

## Team Constitution
As we have four team members in our team, we will be working together throughout the semester to develop a Monopoly game. The main focus will be to divide the work and accomplish the goal together. To maintain a strong bond between the team members, we will try to understand each other's weaknesses and help each other when needed. Similarly, we will make sure that everyone is at the same pace. 

In case of conflicts, we will try to solve it by group discussion and votes of majority. If there has been a misunderstanding, we will need to make sure others are aware.

### Team meetings:
 2 times a week
In person: Right after class on Monday, Business Building
Online: Thursday at 6:30 pm, on Discord
Main method of communication: Discord, Gmail
To ensure everyone attends the meeting, we will remind each other in Discord.
If anyone is not attending the meeting, other team members should be notified.
In case someone misses the meeting, we will try to keep them updated through chat.

### Team Roles: 
Team roles will be different in each sprint. According to class rules, in each Sprint, there will be a new product owner and scrum master. However, everyone is responsible for the project.

### Assigning tasks: 
With group agreement or discussion.

## MVP
The MVP for this project must consist of at least the following:

-A Graphical User Interface which  depicts all players, the board, and any animations showing what occurs during game play.

-A Client which houses the UI and which connects to a game server, this client must be implemented as a desktop client. It may not be a separate web interface

-A microservice providing the game engine



The basic rules of gameplay which include the following

-Setup of a new game between 2 or more connected clients

-Management of the bank (including houses, hotels, money, chance and community chest cards)

-Management of Gameplay

-Roll of the dice

-Knowledge of board state including player locations

-Sending game state data to client 

-Receiving information from clients such as desire to buy property, paying rent, etc.

-Bankruptcy and Handling of End of Game

-Saving the state of the game in a data store, with the option of loading a prior game.

-The basic datastore is simply a named json file. (But this may be replaced, as a feature enhancement, with a database using an ORM)
