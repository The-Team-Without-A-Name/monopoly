WHAT I DID:
Added server, improved gui made by pawan and working on server client connection. As well as helped Fernando with basics of Javafx

WHAT I DIDNT DO:
I didn’t work on junit testing because I don’t have much experience with it so Madison offered to do it for this sprint. 

What I can do better:
I can try to learn junit and server stuff better so I won’t struggle as much implementing the micro service connection.

What we can do better or change:
We can try to stick to goals better I know with midterms some people struggled getting their tasks done. I think next sprint will be better.

I don't really remember what we need to cover in this thing, but here  goes.

For the most part, our team was able to accomplish what we set out to do for
this sprint. I feel like we did a pretty decent job communicating with one
another throughout the sprint. Most group members managed to do most if not all
of the work assigned.

If I were to make some improvements to next Sprint, I would suggest that we be a
little more ambitious with the next Sprint. I feel that the items we need to
accomplish in Sprint 2 are really important to the project, so I would
appreciate if we can be a little more ambitious with our goal setting. I
personally wish I would have gotten more done for this sprint, but I feel like
just a little more time and effort into the next one will be beneficial.

Don't ever be afraid to reach out on Discord with questions. The worst thing we
can do is stop communicating with each other.

The first Sprint Restrosprospective
In this sprint, I tried to make the connection between client and the server. I added the module
info file. Similarly, I made a simple GUI using JavaFx so as to pop up a window which helps us
to enter the IP address and the port number. The other thing is I wrote the team constitution in
the README file.
Although, I couldn’t work much towards making pull requests and processing those requests.
That will be my next thing to do.
From my side, I need to put more time and effort into the work and help my teammates as much
as I can.
I think that we can do better than this. We need to divide things more smoothly so as to finish
our goal. I think every teammate is doing whatever they can do from their side. Starting is
always difficult and is confusing about where to start.
However, the project is going well, everyone is aware about how we did. The communication
among us is going very well. As a team, we will work together supporting each other.

Sprint Retrospective I
What I Did: I was trying to read into the basics of JavaFX and testing due to me not
having as much experience as my teammates. I made it to every meeting and still kept
good communication with my teammates.
What I Didn’t Do: I wasn’t able to do the coding due to me not being as familiar with the
methods and things that my teammates knew. They were aware and were okay with me
trying to teach myself to catch up to them.
What I Can Do Better: I believe that if I can put more effort into learning what my
teammates already know I can help out a lot more and not be a nuisance to them. I
want to be a use to them even if it is something tiny, I want to be able to help them.
What We Can Do Better/Change: As a group, I believe the communication was on
point and there really isn’t much to improve on. Anytime someone has a problem, it is
talked about on Discord. There really isn’t much we could change. I believe the way the
team went through the first sprint was good and it should be sufficient enough to get the
end grade desired if we stay consistent.
