## Method for Documenting Project Requirements

## Project Description

This is a desktop multiplayer Monopoly game that will consist of a client desktop application and a backend server. The client application will provide the front-end interface for the users, but it will not have any game logic. The backend server will contain all of the game logic and game-play processing. It will be implemented as a microservice. The server will be containerized using docker and deployed to the coud.
